# In-situ analysis in Catalyst and Nek5000 with Mesa

In this repository, we describe our implementation of an in-situ adaptor for *Nek5000* and *ParaView/Catalyst*, as well the building process of all its components, and a test case. The setup of the test case partially replicate that of a realistic high-fidelity simulation, but it we employed a sufficiently coarse resolution to allow testing on a standard personal computer.

We are not using this repository for active development. We suggest considering it as a snapshot of a particular state of our code that we consider relevant.

The present document is organized in 4 sections: 1) Funding and contributors 2) Description of the in-situ adaptor and the interface *Nek5000/Catalyst*, 3) Building instructions and 4) Description of the test case.

**Note:** this guide is written to allow building and running the test case without previous experience with *Nek5000* and *ParaView/Catalyst*, but it is not a self-contatined documentation. In particular, section 4 is written assuming that readers have familiarity with *Nek5000*. 

## 1. Funding and contributors


The development of this code is part of the effort undergone by the *In-Situ Analysis of Big Data for Flow and Climate Simulations* consortium to provide new data-analysis tools for numerical simulation. This collaboration is funded by the Swedish Foundation of Strategic Research (project BD15-0082).

The creation of this repository was possible thanks to the following contributors:

1. Dr Niclas Jansson and Mohammad Rezai, who developed the adaptor between the numerical code *Nek5000* and the software for data analysis and visualization *Paraview*, and the building procedure.
2. Anke Friederici, Wiebke KÃ¶pp and Prof. Tino Weinkauf, who worked on the Python pipeline and the timers for performance analysis.
3. Marco Atzori, who provided the test case employed here and composed this guide.

Dr Ricardo Vinuesa, Prof Erwin Laure, Prof Philipp Schlatter and Prof Tino Weinkauf supervised the project. Furthermore, Dr Stefano Markidis gave valuable suggestions in evaluating the performance of the code, and Daniele Massaro and Fermin Mallor carried out tests and performance analyses.

All the contributors and supervisors mentioned above were employed at the KTH - Royal Institute of Technology, in Stockholm, Sweden, when they collaborated at this project.

## 2. In-situ adaptor and interface

The in-situ adaptor includes both the code that converts the data structures from Nek5000 to VTK format, and the interface between Paraview/Catalyst and Nek5000.

The most relevant parts of the code that we developped is contained in the following files:

### *Nek5000/core/3rd_party/nek_in_situ.f*

This file is part of Nek5000. It is modified to include the three subroutines *catalyst_init*, *catalyst_process*, and *catalyst_end* in the corresponding default subroutines for in-situ operations in Nek5000. Note that this is also the file that includes the subroutines for in-situ operation with the visualization software visit. 

### *Nek5000/core/3rd_party/catalyst.f*

This file is not part of Nek5000. It contains the definition of the subroutines *catalyst_init*, *catalyst_process* and *catalyst_end*, which employ default Catalyst functions (such as *requestdatadescription*) as well the ones that we developed for mapping Nek fields in VTK format (such as *creategrid* and *add_scalar_field*). Note that this file also contains timers, which, at present, write a separate record for each MPI rank.

### *Nek5000/core/3rd_party/nek_catalyst.cxx*

This file is not part of Nek5000. It contains the actual adaptor, *i.e.* the functions that map Nek5000 fields in VTK format.

### *Nek5000/core/mkuserfile*

This file is part of Nek5000. It is modified to add the subroutine *catalyst_usrpipe* to the case_name.f, which will be compiled. At present, it only allows for using a single pipeline, with name "pipe.py", located in the working directory.

## 3. Building instructions
These instructions were used to compile Nek5000+ParaView/Catalyst on Ubuntu 18.04 (09/12/2019), with the aim of reproducing a similar build for the HPC system *Beskow* at PDC, Stockholm (Cray XC40).

*make -j*

*make install*

3) export mesa variable, using the script:

```bash
export OSMESA=$HOME/InSituPackage/local

export LIBDIR=$OSMESA/lib:$LIBDIR
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OSMESA/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_RUN_PATH=$OSMESA/lib:$LD_RUN_PATH

      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                                  \
      -DPARAVIEW_INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_FILES=ON                     \
      -DPARAVIEW_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON                                 \

```

**Note:** the last two lines specify the install and the source codes locations, respectively. The forth and third-last lines need to be set according with the system (where Python is installed).

**Note:** in this example, both Mesa and Paraview share the same the path for binaries (*$HOME/InSituPackage/local*).

2) In *~/InSituPackage/build*
*make -j*

*make install*

### 3.4 Nek5000 (v17):

1) Before compiling a case with the InSitu implementation, export Python-path enrivoment variables with the script:

```bash

export PARAVIEW=$HOME/InSituPackage/local
export PATH=$PARAVIEW/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PARAVIEW/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export PYTHONPATH=$PARAVIEW/lib/python3.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PARAVIEW/lib/python3.6/site-packages/paraview/:$PYTHONPATH

```

2) In *makenek* (within the case directory, see below) add:

2.1) a CXX compiler:

```bash
# Fortran/C compiler
FC="mpif77"
CC="mpicc"
CXX="mpic++"

```

2.2) Paraview in the optional compiler flags for the C compiler only:

```bash
FFLAGS="-I./inc_src -g"
CFLAGS="-I./inc_src -I$PARAVIEW/include/paraview-5.6"
```

2.3) Catalyst enviroment variables:

```bash
CATALYST=1
CATALYST_LIBS=`paraview-config --libs vtkPVPythonCatalyst`
CATALYST_INCS=`paraview-config --include vtkPVPythonCatalyst`
```

**Note:** The pipeline has a fixed name, *pipe.py*, and needs to be in the run folder of the simulation.

## 4. Test Case

### Numerical simulation

This test case describes the flow around a NACA4412 at a moderate Reynolds number, and it is intermediate between a tutorial and an example of a realistic CFD simulation. 

The setup shares some similarities with the high-fidelity numerical simulation carried out by Vinuesa *et al.* (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2018.04.017), such as boundary conditions, LES filter, tripping and checkpoint implementation of a realistic simulation. However, the default resolution is much coarser than what needed to provide an accurate description of the flow. In particular, the grid contains 10,500 spectral elements, and we employ polynomials of 3rd order to represent the velocity, resulting in 672,000 grid points (as a comparison, the smallest simulation carried out in the study mentioned above employed 28,000 elements and polynomials of 11th order, resulting in 48,384,000 grid points).


The very coarse resolution allows running on personal computers with standard computational resources but also makes the result of the simulation unreliable.

**Note:** the number of grid points of this test case can be easily increased by increasing the polynomial order.
